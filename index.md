# Research

In natural language processing (NLP), event extraction aims at detecting event instance(s) in texts and identifying the event type together with its participants and attributes, if existing. The obtained structured representations of events can further be used in diverse tasks, such as to expand existing knowledge base, to monitor social events, and so on.
